#Elm Koans

##Instructions
* get [elm](http://elm-lang.org/install)
* clone this repo
* install the dependencies: run `elm package install` from inside the cloned directory
* run `elm reactor` and open a browser to [http://localhost:8000/src/Koans.elm](http://localhost:8000/src/Koans.elm)
* use any editor to change the source files, refresh the browser page, and make the tests pass
  * placeholder values are denoted as `xValueType` and will need to be replaced to make the tests pass

**Note**: You may run the koans in debug mode by visiting [http://localhost:8000/src/Koans.elm?debug](http://localhost:8000/src/Koans.elm?debug) and the display *should* refresh automatically on every file save, however it seems to be finicky so YMMV
